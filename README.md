- **Machine learning (ML â€“ Machine Learning) is a category of algorithms that make software programs more accurate at predicting results without being explicitly programmed. The mainstay of machine learning is to build algorithms that can take input data and use statistical analysis to predict an output while updating the output as new data emerges.**

- **The processes involved in machine learning are similar to data mining and predictive modelling. Both require data searching to look for patterns and adjust program actions accordingly. Many people are familiar with machine learning from shopping online and running ads about their purchases. This is because recommendation engines use machine learning to personalize online ad delivery in near real time. Beyond personalized marketing, other common machine learning use cases include fraud detection, spam filtering, network security threat detection, predictive maintenance, and building news feeds.**

- **There are many methodologies and algorithms for ML. ML is basically divided into three groups according to the learning method;**

    <ul>
        <li>Supervised</li>
        <li>Unsupervised</li>
        <li>Reinforcement</li>

    </ul>
